      <h1>Question 4. Why is it important to mark up your content semantically?</h1>
      <p>We talked about this during week 2. Write up your answer below and mark it up with at least one paragraph tag.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Semantic</em></strong> markup is a way of writing the structure of HTML, so that you can know what the content is from the <strong><em>Semantic</em></strong> phrase, and make the code more neat.</p>
      <p>Also, it can make your code more readable for other people.</p>
      <p>Use the word &ldquo;semantic&rdquo; somewhere in your answer and mark up that word as both strong and emphasized.</p>
