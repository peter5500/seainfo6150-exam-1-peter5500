          <dd>"Uniform Resource Locator" It's a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of URI, although many people use the two terms interchangeably. </dd>
          <li><dt>Server</dt></li>
          <dd>A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet. </dd>
          <li><dt>IP Address</dt></li>
          <dd>"Internet Protocol address" It's a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. </dd>
